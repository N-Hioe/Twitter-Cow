@CC_Sabathia &amp; @RyanRuocco its time to address the elephant in the room. The entire team wore Black Lives Matter shirts warming up &amp; kneeled during a pre-game ceremony yesterday (amazing!). Then Randy Levine invites Trump to throw out a pitch in the Bronx next month?! How? Why?!

@bmwarren93 @silentgrind34 @YannickNgakoue I think its the elephant in the room.

Using the excess material and slag to also build a large statue of a turtle with elephants on its back to carry your OC through space does not qualify it as a disc-world and so will not receive a research grant.

RSS reminds me of an elephant peacefully working, while street-dogs madly bark at it. Its selfless service, will never be appreciated by the curs. The good that it does is not for winning support or praise. It seeks no conversion nor destruction. Just a massive force of good. üôè
